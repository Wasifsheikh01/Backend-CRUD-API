## **CRUD API with Node.js and Express.js**

### **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on mock data using Node.js and Express.js. It is designed as a starting point for developing RESTful APIs and can be expanded with additional features.

### **Features**
- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Developed API endpoints to perform the following operations on mock data:
  - **Create**: Add new data entries.
  - **Read**: Retrieve data entries.
  - **Delete**: Remove data entries.
  
- **Extensibility**: This project can be extended with more functionalities and integrated with databases or front-end applications as needed.

### **Future Plans**
- Add additional features such as authentication, data validation, and error handling.
- Integrate with a real database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to replace mock data.
- Enhance API security and performance optimizations.
